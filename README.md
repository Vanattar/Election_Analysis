## Election Audit Summary
Python has a stable foundation and it is termed "secure language." It has broad support and an extensive selection of open source tools. The current project can be efficiently revised to calculate the results of another election. Further the script can be reused to analyze data for a variable number of counties, or adapted to other regions, i.e. states. Likewise the script will continue be useful even if there is a change in the number of candidates. Any future file must continue to include data for the ballot ID’s, the candidates’ names and the names of regions so that the script can be realigned to analyze new data.
